## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Strict TOML manifests, product/zip sweeps, and safe deck templates.
- Immutable content-addressed render, simulate, extract, and aggregate plans.
- Bounded async scheduling with named resource limits.
- Mock RC and ngspice subprocess adapters.
- Atomic artifact cache, append-only journal, resume, status, and explain.
- JSON/CSV collection, synthetic example, and cross-platform tests.

### Fixed

- Bounded the scheduler's queued work so fail-fast leaves unscheduled branches
  untouched after the first observed failure.
- Rejected impossible resource requests, case-variant artifact collisions, and
  malformed aggregate records before execution or publication.
- Tightened ngspice measurement parsing and versioned its adapter identity.
- Bound every persisted activity payload to its content identity and rejected
  malformed, duplicate-key, and non-finite persistent JSON.
- Replaced file-lock release with a nonce-marker directory protocol so a stale
  owner cannot remove a successor's lock.
